                    <h3>Goal: Learn difference between git and GitHub</h3>
                    <p>
                        Knowing the difference between these two tools by being able to explain what they are to another person will help me much.  By the end of the day, lunch even, grasping these devices is a reasonable expectation.  Take a full hour on the difference of git and github in the beginning.  After that chat with others during breaks to solitify my understanding.  Every day learning more about the tools that used should lead to competence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thanks to material on Learn and my fellow students this was a breeze.  Although in the beginning cloning and setting up a remote had me kabuffled.  Now I know that remote is connecting a local file to GitHub, and a clone is a copy from GitHub to local.  The breakout on the difference of git and GitHub helped solidify my understanding.  I will join breakouts in the future since it helped me with my goals.

                    <p>
                        It seems that staging and committing are a repetitive workflow that keeps a repo happy.  Repetition alone will have this skill completed in no time; before lunch even.  To start I will stage and commit every change, if I am still not getting it within the first hour I will talk with students or a TA for guidence.  Need more quickies like this one.

                        By the third exercise stage and commit was a done deal.  Careful on getting to hurried.  Once adding a remote to a initialized folder for git at least one stage and commit is needed to start a master branch.  Super helpful was using "git status" to see what was going on under the hood.  Taking five minute breaks every half-hour helped keep me focused on this goal.  Need to add breaks often during the day.

                    <p>
                        Knowing where one is in a folder seems to be necessary to a .git folder.  Having PWD as my guide in and out of the directory system will allow me to get a handle on positioning good staging habits quickly by the end of the day.  Taking a little time throught exercise may be the trick.

                        Great resource PWD.  Using it allowed me to cover a lot of ground.  So much so that I got complacent to the right folder I was working.  Concentrating on stage and commit kept me out of focus on the location of work folders.  Next time checking PWD before and after to help get a lock on the position.  Using Finder, on my Mac, gave me a visual to the CLI file structure that I found helpful.  Future work I will try to stay in the CLI and away from Finder.

                    <h3>Goal:  Traversing file system <strike>for git</strike>(carry over).</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you're going to use the command line you need to know how to get from file-A to file-B. This goal is to be able to work with files using the command line.  I plan on using the command line every time I need to go somewhere or open Atom, and even when I need to open anything.  The less I use Macs Finder, the more I know I am learning.  Looking up answers as I get stumped only going to Macs Finder as needed.

                        Being in the file that has the .git is essential if you want any staging or committing to happen.  Slowly went the day until I figured out that little tidbit.  Need to keep tasks and projects files coordinated in order not to slow progress.  Double checking file location will always help.  Using Ranger, a program that becomes the Finder for your CLI, worked wonderfully going through the file structure.  I will use Ranger as much as possible from now on.  Others seem to change location, other than the classroom, during the day.  I should try that to see how it helps.

                    <h3>Goal: Forking and Cloning to local git.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Forking and cloning without looking up how is an excellent measuring technique.  Drill exercises will provide plenty of practice for this goal.  Additionally, I can fork and clone then delete that clone and the fork to repeat the same process.  Create and delete about five times at the start of the day and again after lunch.  Once I can perform this task without fear of breaking the computer I will call this goal done.  By the second go around all will be good.  Only time will tell.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflection: Bravo.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Done and done.  It seems that I got the fork and clone into a file down.  At first confusion after cloning whether or not to "git init."  Think they call that repo in a repo?  After a few of redo's, I realized that if you clone - no init, but if you create a file you init to use remotely.  Some mistakes happened as I cloned into the wrong directory.  Now I use PWD before cloning.  Creating init's and directories, to initialize git, on the fly caused some confusion.  Plan on a little pre-planning in the future.  Taking a walk to get coffee or water will help clear your mind when things get twisted.

                    <h3>Goal: Checking remotes of a repository.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just touching on remotes and their status to get familiar with it.  No pressure on this one.  More of a give-me goal today.  Using the five minute breaks to read up on remotes should be good.  Checking the remotes for a project folder can be done before you do a push up to the repository.  For every commit, I do, I can check the remote before I do a push.  I will take about five minutes checking the remotes at the start of the day and again after lunch.  Git documentation will be my go-to reference.   I will be using the same documentation to practice different tasks that can do to remotes.   Repetition over time will be the key to learning about remotes.  Guess if I need to measure this I can use the ability to explain how to check what remotes a project has to someone else.   No need to rush.

                    <p>
                        Good times on this one.  Got to it near the end of the day.   Found my self-getting sucked in the reading on remotes.  Next time I will set a timer or find something specific to look up.  Remotes seem to be a clone but in reverse.  A timer is a way to go!  If only I had a reminder to use a timer every time.  Right?  Taking some time away from the problem helped keep my mind fresh on the learning.  As I remember to do so, I will use timers.  The very least stand-up and move when things get slow on the studies.
