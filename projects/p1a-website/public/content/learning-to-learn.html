                    I have four children at home, so never a dull catastrophy which is why I came to galvanize for a quiet place to learn. Using headphones to drown out area noise with soothing music. I carry snacks to keep me from wondering about food and not to worry about
                    hunger, and coffee I use to signal break times. Break times gets me moving and experiencing a new place that isn't my laptop. <br /> Speaking of laptops. I minimize or close any tabs or programs that do not provide
                    any use in learning about a subject I want to learn about. Close out of any message boards or turn off notifications. Lastly, I will put my phone on vibrate and usually on a napkin or notepad (if notepad not in use) to soften the vibrations.

                    Started out watching YouTube videos on CSS Grid then decided to follow along with a couple of the videos. Still using the command line to create directories and files then opening atom to work on CSS Grids I tooled along with the speaker and their slides.
                    Had to pause the video mostly to get the grid to work like it did in the lecture by using cheat sheets like the one CSS Tricks has on their site. I finished the video and recreated the example they used. Suprised I was that I was able
                    to duplicate the example and to know basically how it all worked.

                    Finding a quiet location having my snacks and prepping the laptop worked well for me. The one thing I will change is to add a real timer versus using coffee to judge breaks. Many times when I should have gone on break I dug in even deeper on trying to
                    make a CSS rule to work. Once I reached for the coffee and it was ice cold I knew I waited too long for a break. <br /> I really felt I got a lot out of following a video while trying to recreate their examples.
                    Troubleshooting things that did not match the example and the little successes really kept me engaged. Most videos I watch will be mandatory participation.
