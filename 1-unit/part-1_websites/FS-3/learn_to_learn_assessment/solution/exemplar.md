#### Full Crud App

Peter led a live coding session today. We spent all last week covering the basics of express apps, and this week we're putting it all together into a reddit clone. He asked us not to code along, seeing as we'd have all week to recreate the project, the point of the code along was just to show how all the pieces we've covered work together.

I felt- and still feel- very confident with every thing we talked about last week. Express, knex, routes- it all makes a lot of sense. I still wanted to take some notes, so I had a new doc open and ready. Peter started by setting up his express app like usual, and honestly, I've done that enough times that I zoned out a little. Caught up on the news, sent a few funny gifs to Mairin- I wasn't missing anything I hadn't heard before. I checked back in a few times, and recognized everything we were working on, so I didn't really tune back in for most of the project.

I didn't worry about it much, but then after lunch, when it was our turn to recreate Reddit, I hit a wall really quickly. I got my express app built quickly enough (thanks express generator!), but I'm having a hard time figuring out where everything goes. I know how to write a route, but I just can't get it to work when I want it to, and I think I'm putting it in the wrong place. I hope Peter was recording his stuff this morning- I need more work here than I thought.
