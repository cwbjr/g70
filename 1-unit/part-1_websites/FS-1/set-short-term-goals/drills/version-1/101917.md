   * Confusing remote with cloning.
   * Clone from gitHub remote to gitHub

2. * Goal met
   * Practice and recovering from mistakes.
   * Staging from wrong folder. 
   * PWD is your friend.

3. * Goal Not met
   * Never stuck for to long and using PWD help solve issues.
   * So stuck on learning staging and commiting my attention was less on where I was.
   * Check my location before and after and often.
