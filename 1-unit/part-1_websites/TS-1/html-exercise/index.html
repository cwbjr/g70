    <h3>Cities lived in:</h3>
        <p>Many reasons arise in our lives that direct us to live in one city or another.  After the military, I moved to Denver, OH where the person I was dating lived.  Nothing I want to go over that little history lesson right now.  Moving to Houston, TX, however, becomes a journey in search of a new career.  Once I decided to become a construction manager my search for a job began immediately. </p>
        <p>The plan was to travel to California, Texas and back to Ohio determined to find a job as a construction manager.  To keep this short as I was leaving Texas, I was called in for a last minute interview in which a position in the company was offered.  I got a job as a construction manager!  With construction traveling to the various project, sites are to be expected.  One such job landed me in Colorado.</p>
        <p>While I was working in Colorado, my wife visited me, and immediately fell in love with the Colorado mountains.   It was not long after that the whole family moved to Colorado.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Castle Rock, CO <span>&#9829</span> </li>
            <li>Houston, TX <span>&#9794</span></li>
            <li>Denver, OH <span>&#9792</span></li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Cities to visit:</h3>
        <p>Reaching for the stars runs parallel with reaching for destinations our hearts and minds long too experience.  Going to a seminar and resort owned and operated by Tony Robbins in Namale, Fiji, is one of those stars my wife and I are seeking.  When you seek for things when does seeking down under not become an answer?</p>
        <p>Our brothers and sisters down under have always been a place I wanted to go.  The Crocodile Hunter, the movie Crocodile Dundee, and the accent are all reasons to travel to Sidney, Australia.  Need I say more?</p>
        <p>Romantic get-aways, for me, are tied to the old-world architecture and a locations mystic.  A beautiful and rustic location like Prague, Czech Republic, really nails the romanticism in my heart.  Enjoying the atmosphere and its countryside with my wife will be amazing.  Soon, I hope, the wife and I will be arriving at a near airport to start our romantic adventure in Prague, Czech Republic.</p>
