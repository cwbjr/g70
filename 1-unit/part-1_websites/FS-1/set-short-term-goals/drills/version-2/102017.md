##Reflection:
1. * Goal met
   * Help from others and repeating.
   * Day went slow but picked up towards the end.
   * Keep at it.  Guess where I am PWD and repeat.

2. * Goal met (shaky so WIP)
   * I forked, I cloned, I PWD.
   * When staging and commiting I kept trying to do twice. One for clone and one for git. 
   * Stage/commit once and push to clone.

3. * Goal met
   * No stress good reads.
   * Distracted on reading to deep for just a review..
   * Its Saturday and will do what wife tells me to do.
